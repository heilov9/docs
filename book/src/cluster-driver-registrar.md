# CSI cluster-driver-registrar

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

As of Kubernetes 1.14, this side car container is being refactored. The purpose of
this side car container was to automatically register a _CSIDriver_ object containing
information about the driver with Kubernetes. We are currently refactoring this
side car container to be more efficient. In the meantime, developers will now
have to add a CSIDriver object in their installation manifest.

Please see [CSIDriver](csi-driver-object.md) for more information.

## Description

The CSI `cluster-driver-registrar` is a sidecar container that registers a CSI Driver with a Kubernetes cluster by creating a [CSIDriver Object](csi-driver-object.md) which enables the driver to customize how Kubernetes interacts with it.

## Usage

CSI drivers that use one of the following Kubernetes features should use this sidecar container:

* [Skip Attach](skip-attach.md)
  * For drivers that don't support [`ControllerPublishVolume`](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#controllerpublishvolume), this indicates to Kubernetes to skip the attach operation and eliminates the need to deploy the `external-attacher` sidecar.
* [Pod Info on Mount](pod-info.md)
  * This causes Kubernetes to pass metadata such as Pod name and namespace to the `NodePublishVolume` call.

If you are not using one of these features, this sidecar container (and the creation of the [CSIDriver Object](csi-driver-object.md)) is not required. However, it is still recommended, because the [CSIDriver Object](csi-driver-object.md) makes it easier for users to easily discover the CSI drivers installed on their clusters.

For detailed information (binary parameters, etc.), see the README of the relevant branch.

## Deployment

The CSI `cluster-driver-registrar` is deployed as a controller. See [deployment section](deploying.md) for more details.

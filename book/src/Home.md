# Introduction

## Kubernetes CSI Documentation
Welcome to the CSI for Kubernetes documentation repository. Here you will find information on how to use, develop, and deploy CSI plugins, or drivers, with Kubernetes.

## ‼️ Project status: Alpha ‼️ 
CSI support for Kubernetes 1.9 is released as Alpha. This means that while we have worked hard to integrate CSI with Kubernetes, there may be issues. We recommend use only for testing due to increased risk.

## Installation
Please see the [Setup](Setup.html) page for instructions on how to setup Kubernetes support with CSI.
